# Meldworks

Meldworks is a high-performance, long-term multiplayer Minecraft modpack for **1.20.1** on **NeoForge 47.1.106**.

## Vision
Meldworks focuses on a minimal yet deeply integrated simulation experience. Drawing inspiration from **Factorio**, **Satisfactory**, and **GregTech**, it provides a unique identity centered around automation, industrial logistics, and procedural challenge.

## Core Pillars
- **Engineered Progression**: Relies heavily on custom recipes and KubeJS scripting to ensure a tailored, intentional experience.
- **Longevity**: Designed specifically to avoid the common "2-week burnout" by providing deep, rewarding goals and infrastructure requirements.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for stability and fluid gameplay in server environments.
